## 2026-01-13: Project Setup

### Initial App Shell
- Created SwiftUI macOS app project from scratch
- Set up dark mode UI with gradient background (charcoal to near-black)
- Used SF Mono font throughout for terminal/dev aesthetic
- Orange-to-pink gradient title, colored status card accents (cyan/orange/green)
- Keyboard hints footer showing TUI-style shortcuts (j/k, space, /, p)
- Hidden title bar for cleaner look (traffic lights still visible)

### Project Structure
```
GuitarPractice/
├── GuitarPracticeApp.swift   # Main entry, window config
├── ContentView.swift         # Placeholder UI with status cards
├── Assets.xcassets/          # App icon, accent color
└── Info.plist
```

### Documentation
- Created `PLAN.md` with 6-phase development roadmap
- Phases: Data Layer → Library View → Session Management → Practice Timer → Menu Bar → Polish

### Repository
- Initialized git, created GitHub repo: https://github.com/sohara/guitar-practice-swiftui (private)

### Tech Decisions
- **SwiftUI over AppKit**: Declarative, modern, first-class MenuBarExtra support
- **macOS 14.0 minimum**: Access to latest SwiftUI features
- **No external dependencies yet**: Start with URLSession for Notion API

### Next Steps
- Phase 1: Notion API client with async/await
- Keychain storage for API key
- Data models (LibraryItem, PracticeSession, PracticeLog)
